## How to choose your paper

* White is the best color.
* The front should have bright colors.
* All the other pages should be white.
* Needs to be regular paper and not that thick.

## How to Write Your Story

* First thing is to think of the word you're going to say.
* You have to sound out the words and stretch them.
* If you run out of room swoop down or go frompage to page.
* Start from the bottom middle of the paper.
* Need to make the paper out of folds.
* The last thing is to draw your pictures and color them in.
